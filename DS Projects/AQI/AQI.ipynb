All the data used for this project can be accessed from the [EPA Website](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html), which we will pull from directly in this notebook. This dataset contains geographical and time-series data on various factors that contribute to AQI from all government sites. The main goal at the end for you will be to understand how AQI varies both geographically and over time, and use your analysis (as well as other data that you can find) to be predict AQI at a certain point in time for various locations in California.\n",

    "### Question 2a - Cleaning Traffic Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, you will be using other datasets to assist with analysis and predictions. Traditionally, to join dataframes we need to join on a specific column with shared values. However, when it comes to locations, exact latitudes and longitudes are hard to come by since it is a continuous space. First, lets look at such a dataset that we may want to merge on with `epa_data_CA_merged`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the below cell, we have loaded in the `traffic_data` dataset, which contains traffic data for various locations in California. Your task is to clean this table so that it includes only the following columns (you may have to rename some): `District`, `Route`, `County`, `Descriptn`, `AADT`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, where `AADT` is found by taking the sum of the back and ahead `AADT`s (you may run into some issues with cleaning the data in order to add these columns - `.str` functions may help with this). The metric AADT, annual average daily traffic, is calculated as the sum of the traffic north of the route (ahead AADT) and south of the route (back AADT). You also need to make sure to clean and remove any illegal values from the dataframe (hint: check `Latitude` and `Longitude`).\n",

As you can imagine, this can be quite tedious so instead we will use a special type of join called a **spatial join**, which can be done using the package `geopandas`, which is imported as `gpd`. The documentation for `geopandas` is linked [here](https://geopandas.org/docs/reference/api/geopandas.sjoin_nearest.html). Please use this as a resource to do the following tasks: \n",

Moreover, Del Norte and Trinity County have the most missing days and a possible reason is because they are counties with low populations and are in very isolated areas. Del Norte is in the most northwest part of California, bordering Oregon, with a population of about 28,610 people, while Trinity is located in a very mountainous, forested, and difficult to access region and hasa population of about 12,700 people. This makes sense as to why they have the most missing days in the AQI measurement since it must be difficult to attain AQI measurements in those areas since they are not very accessible and of low priority due to their low populations. Furthermore, there may also have been some event that was preventing these counties from data collection since Trinity County has a lot of missing dates in July and Del Norte County has most of missing dates from May to July."

Furthermore, the AQI per month sharply increases midyear for California, while this doesn't seem to occur with the national average. This could be explained by the extreme heat in California during the midyear times, which led to many forest fires during this time of the year. As we know, forest fires are large contributors to air pollution."

This is because if we assume the model follows the same trend as we see in 2020, the AQI averages will peak midyear and dip again, meaning over a span of multiple years, the AQI averages would oscillate up and down. For this reason, f(x) = sinx. If we see a linear increase in the average AQI per year over the last 10 years, then the function would we use would be sinx + x, since the oscillations from the sin function would continue, but would be scaled linearly. Therefore, g(x) = sinx + x"

    "This heatmap makes sense because the dark regions in the graph correspond to latitude and longitude coordinates which lie mostly in forest areas or areas that lie along the ridge of California National Forests. The heatmap shows large AQI numbers for these coordinates during the month of September since there generally tend to be fires during September in these locations. This makes sense with our data since the darkest regions probably signal that a fire, or some other air quality hazard, was in that location during September."

Through the previous few questions we have discussed that wilfire data as well as temperature may be good indicators, but we can explitly look at correlations via the temperature to verify our hypothesis. Like temperature, there are other columns of data such as particulate matter, chemical concentrations, wind data, etc. Your open-ended EDA will be useful for filling in missing points in the heatmap that you created in question 4b. \n",

    "We conducted 3 separate analyses in our EDA. Our first analysis looks at the type of land that the AQI is measured on from aqs_sites. This was an important find because as the bar chart shows, the median AQI varies highly for different types of land. For example, military reservations generally seem to have a significantly higher AQI than the other land types. The second analysis we conducted was to determine whether there was a relationship between weather and AQI. To do this, we decided to compare temperature from daily_temp with the daily AQI data. After looking at the second plot, which is a pairplot of temperature vs. AQI, we observed that there weren't any significant relationships that we found from our samples. Therefore, we concluded that it is not enough to simply use temperature to predict AQI. Furthermore, in our data analaysis, we also came across California's annual AQI fluctuations that occur around midyear. We theorized that California has a high population and high traffic rate in general, so we compared California's traffic and AQI over the year to see how it changed throughout the year. As our third plot shows, the relationship between AQI and AADT (which is a representative of traffic) does vary throughout the year, and we noticed that their relationship was positive for the beginning until we reach midyear, when their relationship dips negative. This may help explain California's AQI fluctuation around the midyear. Since their relationship dips negative, that means AADT has less influence on AQI during these times of the year, leaving AQI to be heavily affected by some external factors. This lead us to conclude that traffic is not what causes these fluctuations, but rather some external factor. "

Simple linear interpolation just takes the locations' values and averages them to produce an estimate of the current location.

    "### Question 8a - Simple Linear Interpolation\n",
    "As previously mentioned, interpolation is a technique that is used to predict labels in a dataset by forming a model out of the data that is already labelled. In this case, we have a pivot table that we use to create a heatmap, but there contains many `NaN` values that we want to fill in. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create the function `fill_bucket` that takes in the following parameters:\n",
    "    - `pivot_table`: the pivot table that we are providing. \n",
    "    - `lat_bucket`: the bucket number that the latitude is in, indexed by zero. ex. if there are 25 buckets, they are numbered $ 0, 2, \\dots 24 $, from lowest to highest value latitudes. \n",
    "    - `lon_bucket`: the bucket number that the longitude is in, indexed by zero. ex. if there are 25 buckets, they are numbered $ 0, 2, \\dots 24 $. from lowest to highest value longitudes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In the pivot table, every value has cells above (A cells), cells below (B cells), cells to the left (L cells), and cells to the right (R cells). We will say that a direction (R for example) is valid if and only if there exists a cell **anywhere** to its right that is not `NaN`. The closest such cell will be called the \"closest R cell\". The same goes for the rest of the directions. For the cases below, assuming that our current cell is called cell K. \n",
    "    - If cell K is not `NaN`, then simply return the AQI at that given cell.\n",
    "    - **Only** if there are **at least** three valid directional cells (ex. has A, B, and L valid but not R valid), we will call K *interpolable*. If K is *interpolable*, then interpolate K by assigning it an AQI value equal to the average of the closest cell AQIs in each of the valid directions. \n",
    "    - If K is *not interpolable*, then do not do anything and simply return `NaN`.\n",
    "- The return value of `fill_bucket` should be the the value assigned to K. **DO NOT** mutate the cell K in the pivot table yet.\n",

This way, we can associate the output numerically, so we can do return loss as an integer. One way we could this is to map integers from 1 to 6 for the different AQI levels. For example: {1: good, 2: moderate, 3: unhealthy} etc. All that is left is for us to choose whether to use L1 or L2. As a group, we decided to use absolute mean error. \n",

    "### Question 10: Creating your own Model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have an idea of how to interpolate values, we will be using something more predictive. In this part, your final goal is to be creating a model and function that uses **at least four** features, with at least one of those four features being from an external dataset that you bring in and process yourself. Here are some rules on the model that you should follow: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using your open-ended EDA analysis, use at least three features in the dataset provided to come up with some sort of predictive model for the AQI for remaining locations not predicted in the heatmap. You are **NOT** allowed to use any more than **one** of the particulate matter features for this model i.e. ozone or CO2 concentrations for example. \n",
    "    - The reason behind this is that AQI is directly based on these values, so there will be in some sense a near 100\\% correlation between AQI and these features under some transformations. \n",
    "- Use at least one feature that comes from an external dataset of choice. Some examples are geographical region (categorical), elevation (quantitative), or wilfire data. \n",
    "    - Reference question 2c of this project to see how to merge external data with the current EPA data.\n",
    "- Your model should, at the end, predict one of the following broad categories for the AQI: good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, or hazardous. Note that this specification is different from `fill_bucket` in the sense that instead of returning a value, you will be returning a string for a category.\n",
    "    - As a result, you can either directly predict the category, or the AQI (ex. through regression) and then convert to the category. Category ranges for AQI can be found online.\n",
    "- The final model should be validated with some data that you hold out. You decide how to do this but there should be some model validation accuracy reported. You should be using the loss function that you designed in question 3 in order to do this.\n",

    "**`features`**: This should be a `pd.DataFrame` object that represents the design matrix that will be fed in as input to your model. Each row represents a data point and each column represents a feature. Essentially your $X$ matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`targets`**: This should be a numpy array that where each value corresponds to the AQI value or AQI category for each of the data points in `features`. Essentially your $y$ vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`build_model`**: This function should have two parameters: `features` that will be used as input into your model as a `pd.DataFrame` object, and `targets` should be a numpy array of AQI values OR AQI categories. It should return a *function* or *object* that represents your model.\n",

    "The model that we created in this section was based off our hypothesis. Since we hypothesized that there is a relationship between AADT(traffic level), geographic land use, time of year and AQI, we chose our features to be these three exact features. We decided to go with random forest regression, as we believed that it would work better than linear regression, since linear is too simple when it comes to categorical variables, like land use. For our input, the AADT values come as integers, however Month and Land Use are categorical, so they need to be one-hot encoded to be properly used in our model. For this reason, the input to Month and Land Use looks the way it does. We output a fully trained model, that is ready for testing. Our method for testing the model was cross-validation. We split the dataset into training and validation sets, and put the model through 5 runs of cross-validation. This way we can compare the accuracy of different models. This basic model returns a cross validation score of around 58% accuracy. We noticed that the accuracy of this initial model was subpar, although it did indicate a relationship between these features and AQI. However, we expected much better from a Data100 model. First of all, there a lot of other features that could also be added on top of these to get a better indicator for AQI. Second, we can also explore different types of regression, as the best type of regression depends on one's specific model. "

While the initial model gets around 58% accuracy, the new model attains up to 94% accuracy. This was able to help us answer our initial research question, which was exploring the relationship between AADT, time, land use and AQI. We learned that the correlation between the feature set and AQI exists, but isn't as strong as we expected. This led us to confirm our hypothesis because the accuracy rate is still greater than 50%, which is the accuracy of a random guess. However, it also helped us conclude that there are defenitely much stronger feature sets that could better predict AQI. We can also compare performances of models through other values, known as precision, recall, and f1. To compare, we calculate these values for both models. The results are shown below:"
